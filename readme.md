# eyros-db

eyros (εύρος. EV-ROS) is a multi-dimensional database that operates on ranges and fixed
coordinates. The ranges could represent spatial coordinate intervals such as a
two dimensional polygon or spans of time with a beginning and an end. In this
way, eyros can be both a geospatial and a time series database. You can even
combine geospatial and time series data because the database works with
arbitrary dimensions.
